SkinManager
-Should handle everything that is skin related.

SkinManager::getInstance().getCurrentSkin() should return the skin name (folder name or xzp file name without the extension)
SkinManager::getInstance().getAvailableSkins() should list every skin as clean name
/* Private or protected, called by contructor */ SkinManager::getInstance().setSkin(string skinName) should load proper font from font.xml, load xur file.
SkinManager::getInstance().loadScene("Main.xur") should load proper scene.

v1 should probably need to have a SetUIApp method that require the CFreestyleUIApp

SkinManager should get current skin name from settings.
if the skin in setting is not there or is blank, should take first skin from available skin list instead of having a hardcoded default skin. (We could still hardcode a default skin in the default fsd2config.xml)


SkinManager should also take care of skin settings, an xml that should be present for every skin :
<skin>
	<settings>
		<displayFPS>TRUE</displayFPS> /* Default is False */
		<ScnProfile>
			<Instance id="TheScnProfileId">
				<HIDEMODE>HIDE</HIDEMODE>
			</Instance>
			<Instance id="TheScnProfileId2">
				<HIDEMODE>OFF</HIDEMODE>
			</Instance>
		</ScnProfile>
	</settings>
</skin>

ConfigurableScene should be updated to get the settings from SkinManager instead of settings label
